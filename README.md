# Course - Bluetooth Low Energy Fundamentals

Material related to taking the course [Bluetooth Low Energy Fundamentals](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/courses/bluetooth-low-energy-fundamentals/).

This is an online course teaching fundamentals of Bluetooth LE, using Nordic Semiconductor devices for hands-on learning.

The course is part of the catalogue of free courses found at [Nordic Developer Academy](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/). An engineering training resource provided by the company Nordic Semiconductors, that develops semiconductors and tools for wireless communication.

## Hardware

A hardware to run the course projects on is required to be able to fully complete the exercises. I personally chose to buy the [nRF52840 DK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-tools/Development-Kits/nRF52840-DK).

A build configuration need to be added for each project. The build configuration will depend on the hardware used. For the above development kit so shall the board target be set to `nrf52840dk/nrf52840`.
